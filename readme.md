-   Decentralized fund collection
-   Secure transfer of funds to the beneficiary
-   Transparent and immutable ledger of all transactions
-   Accessible to anyone with an internet connection
-   Open source code for transparency and community contributions

## Technologies Used

The smart contract is built using the following technologies:

-   Solidity: A programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain
-   Truffle: A development framework for Ethereum-based applications
-   Ganache: A personal blockchain for Ethereum development and testing
-   Ethers js: A JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain

## Getting Started

To get started with the smart contract, you will need to:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine
2.  Install the required dependencies using `npm install`
```shell

npx hardhat  help

npx hardhat  test
